# Software Requirements

## R and RStudio

[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/.

####Windows

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file from CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

####Mac OS X

Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg file from CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

####Linux

You can download the [binary files](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html) for your distribution from CRAN. Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo yum install R`). Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).

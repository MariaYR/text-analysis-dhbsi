# Computational Text Analysis Workshop

### Prepared for the [2015 Digital Humanities @ Berkeley Summer Institute](http://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/summer-institute-2015/)

This series of workshops will focus on working with textual data. Participants will be introduced to tools for computational text analysis using a toy corpus of documents provided by the instructor. We will discuss some of the methodological concerns that accompany these computational methods.

### Topics Covered

* Acquiring and Preprocessing texts
* Discriminating Words
* Dictionary Methods and Sentiment Analysis
* The Vector Space Model and the Geometry of Text (Multi-dimensional Scaling, Most Similar Texts, Clustering)
* Topic Models
* Quantifying Style: Grammar, Alliteration, and other Poetic Concerns

See the entire syllabus [here](A-syllabus.md).

### Requirements

This workship will be using the R programming language. See the software requirements [here](B-Tech-Requirements.md).

Students are strongly encourged to complete [this brief tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r) to learn the basic syntax of the R programming language.
